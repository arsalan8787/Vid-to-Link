"""
event_logger.py
-----------------
Lightweight, low-overhead event bus used to feed the NexiLink Manager Bot
with everything happening in the main bot: new users, download requests,
successes, failures and generic errors.

Design goals (Railway Free Plan friendly):
 - A single `asyncio.Queue` in the same process — no extra service, no
   extra network hop, negligible memory footprint.
 - Persistence (SQLite) happens immediately regardless of the configured
   report interval, so `/stats` in the Manager Bot is always accurate.
 - The queue is only used for *notifications* (immediate forwarding or
   periodic aggregation); if nothing is consuming it yet (Manager Bot
   disabled/not started), events are simply persisted and the queue is
   capped so it can never grow unbounded.
