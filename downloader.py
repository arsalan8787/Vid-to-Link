downloader.py
-------------
Integration layer with yt-dlp for extracting info and downloading video from hundreds of platforms.

Because yt-dlp is synchronous, every call to it runs inside a
thread executor so the main asyncio event loop never blocks.

The architecture is designed so that every yt-dlp update / newly added
extractor automatically adds support for more platforms;
no platform-specific logic is hardcoded in this file (except a few
genuinely necessary YouTube helpers, like choosing the player_client).

Reliability notes and the reasoning behind each design decision:

1) «Sign in to confirm you're not a bot» / «The page needs to be reloaded» /
   «Requested format is not available»:
   These errors almost always happen for one of these reasons:
      a) The chosen YouTube player_client is temporarily broken;
           YouTube constantly blocks/unblocks different player clients.
      b) The high quality format needs a PO Token (Proof-of-Origin), which cannot
         be generated without a real provider.
   Solution: instead of hardcoding one fixed combination of clients (which breaks
   every few weeks), a fallback ladder is used: first
   yt-dlp's own defaults are tried (kept up to date by its maintainers),
   then a few other known-good combinations. In addition, installing
   `bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider` + Deno (see Dockerfile)
   generates a real PO Token, enabling reliable high quality (720p/1080p/4K) DASH downloads
   — this has been directly tested and confirmed.

2) Fake qualities (27p/45p/108p) -> these are 'storyboard' formats (the scrub-bar
   preview tiles), not real video. They are now explicitly filtered
   out (see `_is_real_video_format`).

3) File size used to only show correctly for 360p -> because on YouTube, formats above
   360p are usually DASH (separate video/audio files), so the video-only file
   alone did not include audio size. Size is now video size + best available
   audio format size (see `_build_quality_options`).

4) 'The downloaded file is empty' at 720p/1080p -> this usually means
   the selected format's URL required a PO Token and without one returns an
   empty/truncated response. Installing a PO Token provider fixes this; additionally
   a fallback chain was added to the download itself: if the final file is 0 bytes,
   it automatically retries with a different client/format combination, so
   the user never ends up with an empty file.

5) Selected quality not matching the actually downloaded quality -> the format is now
   locked to the exact `format_id` identified when qualities were listed (not
   just a generic height cap), so the format whose size was shown to the user
   is the one actually downloaded (with a safe fallback if it's gone by download time).

6) Multi-platform support (e.g. PornHub used to return HTTP 403) -> these sites
   usually have a TLS-fingerprint-based anti-bot layer and need `impersonate`
   (real Chrome/Firefox/Safari browser impersonation via curl_cffi)
   which is why installing `yt-dlp[default,curl-cffi]` (see requirements.txt)
   lets extractors like PornHub use this automatically;
   this was directly tested: without curl_cffi you get a 403, with it the request
   succeeds.

    Root cause of "only 360p is available" on YouTube (investigated and

    For a YouTube URL this used to try player_client combinations one at a
    time and *return immediately after the very first attempt that produced
    ANY real quality option at all* — even if that attempt only exposed
    360p because the specific client used for that attempt is one of the
    clients YouTube requires a PO Token for (see the PO Token guide) and
    the higher-resolution DASH formats were silently absent from that
    client's format list (not blocked — just never listed). The later
    attempts in `_client_attempts()` (e.g. ``tv``+``web_safari``, which does
    NOT require a PO Token) that could have exposed 720p/1080p/4K were then
    never even tried, because the loop already returned.

    Fix: for YouTube, every client combination is now tried and the
    resulting formats are *merged* (deduplicated by ``format_id``) into a
    single pool before building the quality ladder, so the final list of
    qualities shown to the user is the union of everything reachable across
    every client — not just whatever the first (possibly PO-Token-limited)
    client happened to expose. To keep this cheap on Railway's limited
